# Counting Squares
These notebooks are my walk-through analysis, (including visualization, polynomial regression and more), of some data regarding the growth of squares
to be able to solve the puzzle of counting all the squares you could see in a grid of any size.

I first solve the problem for a simple squares case, then move to solving a more complex version for a grid with diagonals.

# Installing the Notebooks
First install [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry), a Python dependency manager.

Then, from the directory of wherever this repository was cloned to your file system, run:

`poetry install`

# Running the Notebooks
Running the notebooks is a simple as running the command:

`poetry run jupyter-notebook`
